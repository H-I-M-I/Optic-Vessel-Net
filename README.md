Retinal Blood Vessel Segmentation Using UNET

This repository contains an implementation of a U-Net model designed for segmenting retinal blood vessels from fundus images. Retinal vessel segmentation plays a crucial role in medical imaging, assisting in the early detection and diagnosis of diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and cardiovascular conditions.

## Features
- **U-Net Architecture**: A well-known convolutional neural network designed for biomedical image segmentation.
- **Dataset**: Uses preprocessed retinal fundus images for segmentation.
- **Output**: Segmented images highlighting the retinal blood vessels, suitable for further classification or diagnostic tasks.
- **Customizability**: Easily adjustable parameters for experimentation and performance tuning.

## Applications
- Early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma.
- Cardiovascular risk assessment using retinal imaging.
- Preprocessing step for advanced retinal image analysis systems.
